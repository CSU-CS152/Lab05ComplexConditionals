# Reminder on Combination Operations
Combination operations, or operations like += and -= are a combination of the math operation and the assignment operation. 
This means that x += 3 really means x = x + 3. These are essentially just short hand for when you're doing simple math to a variable and want that that to go back into the variable. If you want to have full control over your order of operations, I recommend using x = x + 3 instead, so that you can do things like x = (x + 3) * 4.

# Reminder on % (modulo) and //
% and // are sort of opposites. Both do division on the numbers to the left and right of them. 
However, % will get the remainder of that division (Ex. 7 % 3 = 1).
// gets the whole number of the divison, or the number on the left side of the decimal (Ex. 7 // 3 = 2).
